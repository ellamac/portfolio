      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I aim to create successful user experiences, usable interfaces, and
        accessible systems. I am a fresh master's graduate of cognitive science
        from the University of Jyväskylä. In my studies, I focused on
        user-centered design and further developed my programming skills from my
        undergrad in computer science by focusing on web development. I enjoy
        combining my understanding of users and knowledge of coding by
        considering all aspects of the software development process in my work.
        I believe bridging the gap between designers and developers is crucial
        when building successful products and experiences!
