      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        In all my work, my goal is to create successful customer experiences. I
        believe accessible systems, usable interfaces, and user experiences
        should be considered in all stages of a product's life cycle. I am a
        master's graduate of cognitive science from the University of Jyväskylä.
        In my studies, I focused on user-centered design and user research. I
        further developed my programming skills from my undergrad in computer
        science by focusing on web development. I enjoy combining my
        understanding of both users and the tech stack. I believe bridging the
        gap between users, product owners, designers, and developers is crucial
        when building successful products and experiences!
